# TODO

There are a large number of to do items for this project.

At this point there is effectively a working demo that can connect to a database and display some data.

Missing from this (in no particular order):

- Authentication - you can't actually log in at the moment.
- Authorisation - even if you could log in there is no security
- Functionality
-- Normal users need to be able to:
--- Register
--- Edit their details
--- Vote in an election
-- Administrative users need to be able to many more things for example:
--- Create an election
--- Delete (or mark as inactive) a user
--- Change user committee membership
- Tests
-- Backend flask application
-- Frontend AngularJS
- Fixing Gruntfile.js
- Licensing - need to settle on a license
